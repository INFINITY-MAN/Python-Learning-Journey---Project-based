Project #2: The Classic Number Guessing Game! 🎮
And I'm back with another project! This is my second one on GitHub, and I'm really starting to get the hang of things. It's such an amazing feeling to see the logic come together with loops and if/elif/else statements. I even managed to code this one without a single error, which felt a little weird but also super cool!

What I've Built So Far 🚀
It's a fun and simple number guessing game where the computer thinks of a secret number, and you have to guess it! It's a great way to practice core programming concepts, and honestly, it's just a blast to play.

What Crazy Idea Should I Try Next? 🤔
Now that the basic game is working, my mind is buzzing with ideas for what to do next. What do you think would be the coolest upgrade?

Give it a GUI? 🎨 Should I design a cool, interactive interface for it?

Make a Super Complex Version? 🐺 Maybe I could evolve this into something wild, like a text-based Werewolf game with lots of logic and secrets.

Add Cute Pop-Up Animations? ✨ Or... just add some adorable and satisfying animations for correct or incorrect guesses? Hahaha!
