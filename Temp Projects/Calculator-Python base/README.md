My First Real Project on GitHub! A Simple Calculator calculadora
Hey everyone! So, I'm officially on my journey to becoming a developer, and this is my first time building something and syncing it up on GitHub like a real pro. It's a huge step for me, and I'm so excited to share it with you all!

What I've Built So Far 🚀
This is a simple, command-line calculator that I built using Python. It's my very first project, and I'm pretty proud of it! Here's what it can do:

Addition ➕

Subtraction ➖

Multiplication ✖️

Division ➗

Modulus (to find the remainder) %

Where Should I Go From Here? 🤔
This is just the beginning, and I've been brainstorming some fun ideas for where to take this project next. I'd love to hear what you think!

Build a GUI? 🎨 Maybe I could give this calculator a cool visual interface.

Gemini API for Complex Calculations? 🧠 What if I could use the Gemini API to handle some seriously complex math problems?

Dog Animations? 🐶 Or, maybe I could just add some cute dog animations to make it the best calculator ever.

I'm still learning, so any and all suggestions are welcome. For now, though, I'm just happy to have this first project under my belt.

Bye bye for now! 👋
